I carried out various analyses to determine the strengths of different companies and understand the behavior of their customers, helping to define value propositions based on market benchmarks. I developed product recommendation algorithms that considered the companies' operational and results dimensions. I conducted a study of the refrigerated logistics market in Chile, identifying opportunities for the company and understanding competitiveness in each region where it operates. Through quantitative analysis of the models practiced, I helped implement a new Go-To-Market model in a distribution company.

I also helped design a customer loyalty policy using clustering algorithms to identify similar customers and define communication guidelines. I proposed new KPIs and metrics to validate the effectiveness of the sales force in different teams. I led a project to identify opportunities for operational improvements in the assortment of animal nutrition products, as well as geomarketing analyses to identify levels of competition and opportunities by region using data extracted with web scraping techniques. I developed a revenue projection tool, including end-to-end sales pipeline data with a graphical user interface and PowerBI analysis. I always use market reports and research to support my analysis and decisions.
